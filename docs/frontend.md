# Understanding Frontend Package Management

Frontend packages are managed by Bower and Brunch to generate the `public` folder ,the only thing you need when you deploy your theme.

## App Folder

The app folder is where all your theme assets files must be placed (images,scss,fonts,js,...).
this folder will be watched by [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch) build tool in order to generate the `public` folder.

## App Folder structure ?

Here is the the app folder structure

```
├── assets
├── scripts
├── scss
    ├── editor
    │   ├── ....
    ├── editor-rtl
    │   ├── ....
    ├── styles
    │   ├── ....
    ├── styles-rtl
    │   ├── ....
    ├── _variables.scss
```

**1 - assets**

The folder will contains all your theme static files (images,fonts, html , ...), which will be copied to `public` folder(autogenerated).

**2 - scripts**

The folder will cotains your theme javascript files.
All files in this folder will be concatenated to `public/js/app.js`


**3 - scss**

1. editor : containes editor style(autogenerated from your styles and written to `public/css/editor.css`)
2. editor-rtl : containes editor RTL style(autogenerated from your styles and written to `public/css/editor-rtl.css`)
3. styles : containes your theme styles (written to `public/css/app.css`)
3. styles : containes your theme RTL styles (written to `public/css/app-rtl.css`)
4. _variables.scss : the file containes the boostrap variables , and you can add your own varibales to this file too .(the file is included in your main style file by default)

## New packages With Bower

Bower will handle adding new packages for your theme , new packages will added in `bower_components` folder , brunch will use this folder when it generates the `public` folder.

For instance , here is how to add underscore to your project :

`bower install unserscore --save`

And you are good to go :)

##Brunch commands

* `brunch build` — Compile and optimize the files in your app directory
* `brunch watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `brunch build --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).
