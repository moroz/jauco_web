2. if you want libsass instead of ruby to compile sass change to this in your `brunch-config.coffe` file:

```coffeescript
config =
  plugins:
    sass:
      mode: 'native' # set to 'native' to force libsass
```

## Theme development

*Brunch Wordpress Theme* uses [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

**1 - Install Brunch and Bower**

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

From the command line:

1. Install [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g brunch bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

**2 - Available Brunch commands**

* `brunch build` — Compile and optimize the files in your app directory
* `brunch watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `brunch build --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).
